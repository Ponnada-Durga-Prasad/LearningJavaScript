## JavaScript Basics: Arrays, Conditionals, and Loops

This guide covers the basics of three essential JavaScript concepts: Arrays, Conditionals, and Loops, including detailed explanations and integrated code examples.

## Arrays

### What is an Array?

An array is a data structure that stores multiple values in a single variable. Each value in an array is called an element and is accessed by its index, starting from 0.

### Example: Creating and Accessing an Array

You can create an array using square brackets `[]`, and access its elements using their index.

```javascript
const fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Output: Apple
console.log(fruits[1]); // Output: Banana
console.log(fruits[2]); // Output: Cherry
```

### How to run the JS programs

For executing js programs you need to install node or you can use any online compiler. we can execute the Javascript by program with this command "node filename.js".
